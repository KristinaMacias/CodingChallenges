// Break Camel Case

// Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

// Example
// "camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
// "identifier"   =>  "identifier"
// ""             =>  ""

function solution(str) {
  let result = str.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function (x) {
    return " " + x;
  });
  return result;
}

console.log(solution("camelCasing")); // "camel Casing"

// Explanation:
/*
/[A-Z]/g: This regular expression matches any uppercase letter ([A-Z]) in the input string. The g flag ensures that all occurrences of uppercase letters are replaced, not just the first one found.
The replace method then takes each uppercase letter found by the regular expression and replaces it with a space followed by the uppercase letter itself, effectively breaking up camel casing.
*/

// Add Length

// What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

/*
Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

  return str.split(" ").map((word) => word + " " + word.length);

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

// isIsogram

/*
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false

/*
The Story:
Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

Task Overview:
You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

Usage Examples:
cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

*/  

function enough(cap, on, wait) {
  return on + wait <= cap ? 0 : -(cap - on - wait);
}

console.log(enough(10, 5, 5)); // 0
console.log(enough(100, 60, 50)); // 10


// Remove elements
/*
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
*/
function removeEveryOther(arr){
  return arr.filter((e, i) => i % 2 == 0)
}
//Flatten and sort an array

/*
Challenge:

Given a two-dimensional array of integers, return the flattened version of the array with all the integers in the sorted (ascending) order.

Example:

Given [[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]], your function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Addendum:

Please, keep in mind, that JavaScript is by default sorting objects alphabetically. For more information, please consult:

You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

The input array will always be valid! (odd-length >= 3)
